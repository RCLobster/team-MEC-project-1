AS a user
WHEN I type in a search parameter
THEN I get a response listing all books that meet my desired search

WHEN I search for a book
THEN my search is saved in localStorage
WHEN I click the search button 
THEN I am given a displayed list of every book related to my search with an attached image

WHEN I click on a recent search
THEN the website re-searches that query

WHEN I click on a search result
THEN I am linked to a page where I can buy that book

WHEN I click the “clear history” button
THEN my recent search history is cleared and localStorage is emptied
